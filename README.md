This is an arduino app suitable for training math in lower and middle school. It allows configuring difficulty level as well as operations and lets the player choose the correct result from a selection of 4 outcomes in a kind of multiple-choice question. An additional mode formulates tasks in the form of equations to make the complementary arithmetic operations more intuitive to understand.
